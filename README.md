# NL2SQL MCP Hackathon Starter

Welcome to VaaniDB... Your talking database tool that let's you practically chat with your data without needing any knowledge about SQL or any such complex technical jargon. Be it seeking information on sales, understanding your datasets better, or anything you can think of. All you need to do is upload your data to our system in the form of an Excel CSV file, and you are all set to chat with it in the language that makes you human-Natural Language! English, Hindi, Bangla... you name it!!!

The only limit is your imagination!

## Note

To judges reviewing my submission. While my MCP server couldn't be made available on the Puch AI whatsapp assistant due to documents not yet being supported on the same; please note that I have pasted the link to a working prototype of what I intended to build and reach out to a **larger customer base, consisting of small to large business owners**, who are in need for a tool that **let's them pratically talk to their data, with needing the expertise of a database engineer**.  


## Features

1. No SQL or technical knowledge required – Just ask your question naturally.
2. Multi-lingual support – Works in English, Hindi, Bangla, and more.
3. Instant CSV upload – Quickly connect your dataset to start querying.
4. Natural Language → SQL → Natural Language – Understandable results without database jargon.
5. Cloud-based – No installation needed, accessible from anywhere.
6. Flexible use cases – From business analytics to education, research, and beyond.


## How It Works?

1. Upload your CSV file – The system ingests and stores it in a secure database.
2. Ask a question in natural language – e.g., “Show me the total sales in Mumbai last month.”
3. AI converts your question to SQL – Using Sarvam AI to ensure accurate database queries. Sarvam AI also enables VaaniDB to work on multiple languages.
4. Results are explained back in plain language – No more squinting at raw tables.


## Potential Impact

By removing the technical barriers to database access, VaaniDB can:
1. Enable small business owners to perform their own analytics.
2. Help non-technical team members explore and understand data.
3. Support multi-lingual markets where English proficiency may be limited.


## Future Roadmap

1. Document and Spreadsheet Parsing: Support Excel, Google Sheets, and PDFs for richer data sources.
2. User Authentication & Multi-User Support: Secure user accounts with data isolation and sharing features.
3. Advanced Analytics: Integrate visualization tools and predictive analytics for deeper insights.
4. Mobile App: Native Android and iOS apps for data querying on the go.

Thank you for considering VaaniDB! I am excited about the potential of enabling everyone to talk to their data effortlessly.
